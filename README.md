# idwr
This project contains the source code of the IDWR interpolation algorithm and also the code used for its evaluation, as described in the paper:

 L. R. Emmendorfer, G. P. Dimuro, A point interpolation algorithm resulting from weighted linear regression (to appear, 2021)
 
The file "idwr.py" contains the Python code of IDWR and also IDW.

Some demostrations on how to use IDWR, sample datasets and also the code used to build some tables and figures in the paper are also available in the folder "demos".   
 
The IDWR was initially proposed in:

 L. R. Emmendorfer, G. P. Dimuro, A novel formulation for 
 inverse distance weighting from weighted linear regression, in:
